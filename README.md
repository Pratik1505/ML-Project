To address the challenges posed by climate variability on agricultural productivity, we propose an Agricultural
Yield Prediction System. This system leverages advanced Machine Learning techniques, including Linear
Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor, and
AdaBoostRegressor. Deployed on AWS using Flask, these models analyze provided datasets to forecast crop yields
accurately. Evaluation metrics like the r2 score are employed to assess model performance, ensuring reliable
predictions. By providing actionable insights, this system aids agricultural decision-making, mitigating the adverse
effects of climate variability on crop yields and reducing potential economic losses
